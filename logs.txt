Laplacian is not being learned. Test X-DH with learned objects not working,
not at all.
TO DO:
Try with smooth signal learning.
BAD THING:
Smooth signal learning doesn't work like this learning, you have to put a pairwise
distance matrix, that would be maybe pairwise distances from the image of signal.

I get an error like this when trying to run Simulation NÂº2:

Warning: Your Hessian is not symmetric. Resetting
H=(H+H')/2. 
Error using ipqpcommon
The interior-point-convex algorithm requires all
objective and constraint values to be finite.

P goes to infinity in a subcycle in HeatLipL.m
Everything is fault of the L update, need to restructure everything.
